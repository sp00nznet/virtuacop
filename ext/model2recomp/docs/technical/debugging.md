# Debugging a Model 2 Recomp

A recompiled game has no debugger stop, no single step and no disassembly view
at runtime — the guest *is* your program. What it does have is a small set of
environment variables and one technique that answers most questions.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MODEL2_TRACE=N` | Print the first N function dispatches, indented by call depth |
| `MODEL2_SCREENSHOT=path` | Write the final frame as a binary PPM when the frame limit is reached |
| `MODEL2_SHOT_EVERY=N` | With `MODEL2_SCREENSHOT` set, also write `path.<field>.ppm` every N fields |
| `MODEL2_INPUT=a,b,...` | Drive buttons for a headless run — `coin1`, `coin2`, `start1`, `start2`, `service`, `fire`, `reload`, `test`. Each is **pulsed** (6 fields down, 54 up, staggered), because coins and start are edge triggered and a held button gives one edge and then nothing. `test` is a switch and is held. |
| `MODEL2_POLYCOUNT=N` | Every N fields, print how many polygons the geometry engine produced. Zero means the game is not submitting a display list — a different problem from one that draws nothing. |
| `MODEL2_WATCH=0xADDR` | Print every 32-bit write to that address, with the value, the guest function doing it, and FP/SP. A memory watchpoint, and the fastest way to find who corrupted something. |
| `MODEL2_IRQMODE=0\|1\|2` | How the interrupt handler is entered. See **The interrupt frame** below. |
| `MODEL2_LEAK=1` | Name functions that return with the guest stack higher than they found it, and report the stack high-water mark at exit. See **Frame leaks** below. |
| `MODEL2_RAMDUMP=path` | Write the 1 MB work RAM image at the frame limit. Diffing two runs that diverge finds the variable that made them diverge. |
| `MODEL2_SHADE=N` | Dump how the first N polygons of a field resolve their colour - texture flag, luma, palette entry, ramp values. A polygon that draws wrong is nearly always its palette entry rather than the fill. |

A game project normally adds its own field limit (Virtua Cop uses
`VCOP_MAX_FRAMES=N`), because the guest's busy-wait gives no other place to
stop. `model2recomp_set_frame_limit()` is the API behind it.

## The hang

> The window opens, nothing is drawn, and the process never exits.

`MODEL2_TRACE=200` and look at the **last line**. That is the function the
guest is spinning in. Then:

- **Spinning on `0x0098000C`?** Your bus is not routing that read to
  `model2recomp_field_sync()`. Nothing advances without it. See
  [execution-model.md](execution-model.md).
- **Spinning on `0x00980004`?** The output-FIFO-empty polarity is backwards,
  or the coprocessor never booted.
- **Spinning on the I/O board DPRAM?** A command was raised and never
  acknowledged.
- **Spinning somewhere in game code?** It is waiting on a value that a
  subsystem should have produced. Find what it loads in the loop, and work out
  who writes it.

## The black screen

> It runs, the frame counter advances, nothing is drawn.

Check in this order:

1. **Is the geometry engine getting a list?** `geo_polygon_count()` after a
   parse. Zero means either the game has not submitted one yet (attract mode
   can take 20 seconds of game time) or the display list is not reaching buffer
   RAM.
2. **Are polygons being rejected?** Culling, clipping and the z-sort each throw
   work away. A count that is non-zero before clipping and zero after is a
   clipping or viewport problem.
3. **Are they being drawn black?** That is almost always the palette, not the
   rasterizer — `palram[0x1000 + colorbase]` reading zero selects ramp 0 for
   every channel. See the colour path in
   [graphics-pipeline.md](graphics-pipeline.md#the-colour-path).

## `[func_table] MISS` lines

```
[func_table] MISS: no function at 0x00002564
```

Mostly harmless. `bx (gN)` returning through a saved `g14` looks like an
indirect branch to an address that is not a function entry; a miss returns to
the caller, which is the correct behaviour. The log is capped at 20 lines.

A miss on an address you *expected* to be a function is different — that is a
function your lifter never discovered. Common causes: it is only reachable
through an interrupt table, or it sits past alignment padding that the scan
treated as the end of the previous function.

## Finding out why guest code never runs

This is the technique that answers "why does this function never execute", and
it is mechanical rather than clever:

1. Build a **callee → caller** map from the generated C — every
   `func_table_call(0xADDR)` and every direct call gives you an edge.
2. Capture the set of addresses that appear in a `MODEL2_TRACE` run.
3. **Breadth-first search backwards** from the function you expected to run,
   until you hit one that did.

The first unexecuted function on that path is the gate — the thing that decides
not to call the next. Go read it.

If the search reports *no executed ancestor at all*, the function is not
reachable in your call graph, which usually means the lifter never found its
entry point. That is how Virtua Cop's scene renderer was found.

## The interrupt frame

Recompiled code has no instruction boundary to interrupt, so the handler is
called at the field boundary. On real hardware, taking an interrupt **pushes a
stack frame**, and the handler ends in a plain `ret` that pops it. Called bare,
that `ret` pops a frame nobody pushed - once per field - and the frame pointer
walks down the chain until it leaves work RAM, after which every frame-relative
load in the guest reads ROM.

`MODEL2_IRQMODE` selects the model:

| Mode | What |
|---|---|
| `0` | Call the handler bare. Wrong; kept because it is a useful A/B. |
| `1` | `i960_do_call` first, so the handler's `ret` pops its own frame. |
| `2` (default) | Snapshot the whole context, call, restore. Same guarantee, simpler. |

Mode 2 was *not* usable for a long time, and the reason is worth knowing
because it is the shape of a whole class of recomp bug: **two leaks in the
lifted code were pushing the guest stack up, and mode 0's unbalanced `ret` was
pulling it down, so the two errors cancelled.** Fixing either one alone made
things visibly worse. Both are described under **Frame leaks**; with them
fixed, mode 2 is correct and is what the reference title renders and plays in.

## Frame leaks

`MODEL2_LEAK=1` reports functions that return with the stack higher than they
found it, innermost first, plus the stack high-water mark at exit. On Virtua
Cop it names one:

```
[leak] 00074E20 left sp 00500600 -> 00500780
```

`0x00074E20` is inside the printf family. Its generated C opens with
`I960_SP = I960_SP + 0x180` and then takes a branch that the lifter turned into
a tail call, because **function discovery split the real function in two**: the
data table at `0x00074DE0` — a hex-digit table and the string `(nul)` — follows
a `ret`, which is exactly what a function entry looks like. The path taken
through the second half falls off the end of its generated C without ever
reaching a `ret`, so the `0x180` is never given back.

Both known leaks came from function discovery, and both are fixed in
virtuacop's lifter:

- **A `ret` is not the end of a function.** A conditional branch that skips an
  early return leaves one in the middle; the code after it is a continuation.
  `post_ret -= branch_targets - calls`: a branch names a label, a call names a
  function.
- **Switch jump tables are not named by anything.** `ld table[gN*4], gM`
  followed by `bx (gM)` dispatches through a table of code addresses that no
  call or branch mentions, so the targets are never discovered, the dispatch
  misses, the whole switch does nothing, and the frame the caller allocated is
  never given back. Harvesting the table at lift time found 188 more functions
  in Virtua Cop - and unblocked the game's own state machine.

If `MODEL2_LEAK` names a function on a title you are porting, look for one of
these two shapes first.

## Comparing against MAME

MAME is the ground truth for this hardware, and running the same ROM set in it
side by side settles most arguments about what the picture should look like.
For anything numeric — a matrix, a display list, a palette — it is faster to
add a temporary `fprintf` here and reason about the values than to try to catch
the same moment in an emulator.

Two things worth knowing when you do:

- The attract sequence is **not deterministic** across runs here, because the
  field boundary is driven by wall-clock time. Two runs stopped at the same
  field number can be in different scenes. Sample with `MODEL2_SHOT_EVERY`
  rather than trusting a single frame number.
- Values that look like garbage often are not. `2.29589e-41` as a float is the
  bit pattern `0x00004000` — a small integer read as a float. Denormals in a
  dump usually mean you are looking at the wrong kind of data, not corrupt
  data.
